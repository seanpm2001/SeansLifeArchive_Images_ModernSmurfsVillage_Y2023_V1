### Overview

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

I finally resumed gameplay of this game today, after a hiatus that almost lasted 2 full years. I started after midnight. I originally was only going to play Motor World Car Factory today, but I managed to squeeze MSV into my session. This is going to continue on a daily basis. - 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

I played after midnight again today, but had to quit early, as I became too tired to keep playing. - 2023, Thursday, August 3rd

I played after midnight again today, and played for a while, before deciding to go to bed really late. I was able to not get tired while playing, I just didn't go through everything, as I didn't feel like playing all minigames. The game is really enjoyable and nostalgic for me. - 2023, Friday, August 4th
